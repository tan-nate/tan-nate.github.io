This was a super challenging project that really helped me learn a lot about coding. It really tested my ability to bring together a lot of the major concepts I've learned up to now -- MVC, authentication, sessions, user interface, CSS, HTML, and more. 

Here are some of the resources I found super useful:

https://codepen.io/silkine/pen/jldif - This was a great newspaper-style site on codepen that gave me a lot of direction stylistically.

https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/ - It was really helpful to use the flexbox strategy for my app.

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#nested-forms - I don't know how many times I used this Form Helpers document to guide me in the right direction. Super essential. 

https://joesasson.github.io/2017/03/24/setting-up-a-rails-app-with-rspec-and-postgres.html - This helped my get my app started on postgres and rspec. 

https://medium.com/@TheDickWard/self-referential-relationships-aka-self-joins-in-rails-64f8f36ac311 - This was a lifesaver for implementing a self-referential relationship: that quotes support or oppose each other. 

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp - great little resource for how to make a nav bar

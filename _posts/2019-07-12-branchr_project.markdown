This was my Sinatra project. It was definitely an adjustment to transition from the problem solving mindset of procedural and object-orientation to the more structural/architectural mindset of Sinatra. But it was definitely worth it. The corneal gem https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal was super helpful in getting everything set up. Overall good learning experience.

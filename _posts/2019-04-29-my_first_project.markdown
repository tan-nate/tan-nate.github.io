My first project - the CLI-Data-Gem project - was pretty tough. It was hard to start with an empty slate instead of having Learn's premade tests to support me. 

The file setup was tough, and conditioning myself to use the bin folder to test my app, as well as building my objects, etc. This video helped a lot:

Once my program was functional, the gem setup was tough, but with a little help from the links below and a bunch of head-scratching, I was able to get my gem up and running on rubygems.org

I'm so glad/proud I've got my program up and running! Yoohoo!

This project was a super amazing exercise that really challenged me to put together a lot of the concepts learnt thus far. Here are some of the resources I found super helpful:

- easeljs library. https://www.createjs.com/easeljs . This library enabled me to put in a drawing canvas into my app. 
- This article was super helpful in creating a horizontally scrolling container. https://codeburst.io/how-to-create-horizontal-scrolling-containers-d8069651e9c6
- this resources was essential in figuring out how to pass data from a ruby class method to json within the to_json method. https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/Serialization/to_json
